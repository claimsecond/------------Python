This is a try to implement some typing in Python using ["Typed Python for professional development"](https://to.digital/typed-python/intro/intro.html) as a reference. 
I've changed weather provider from OpenWeather to weatherapi.com due to free access to the api on the latter. Coordinates retrieved using winsdk compared to using whereami software in the handbook.
I didn't hide an API key in .env or using other approaches because free account api key expiring every 2 weeks. 
I've added also requirements.txt just in case you'll wish to run the code ;)
